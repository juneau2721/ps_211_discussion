# Communication logistics

:: content ::

- We will use **Slack** for class communication. Everyone should be added. Please reach out to Kate or Juneau if you are not yet on the Slack workspace.

- Please check Slack regularly for important announcements. 

- Please also use the Slack to ask questions about course material!

    - In general, our policy is that if you ask us a question about course material, we will publicly post it (anonymously, if you desire) and the answer on Slack, so that everyone can benefit from the learning opportunity.


- That said, our hope is that you will take advantage of lecture, discussion, and office hours to ask questions **IN PERSON**. If you send us a content-based question via email or slack, we may ask you to come to office hours or ask during lecture/discussion instead.
