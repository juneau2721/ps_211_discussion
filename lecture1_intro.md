The other aspect is **slots**.  Slots are a basic part of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/slots.html).  In Slidev slots can be marked using `:: slotname ::` and then filled in with content.  For example, the `:: left ::` and `:: right ::` slots on this slide are filled with content.

Slots effectively help you map parts of your slide to different parts of a layout.  The most common case is to say which content appears in the left column and which appears in the right column. But different layouts can have different slots and different content.
