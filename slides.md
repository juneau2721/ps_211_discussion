# Discussion Section Goals

:: content ::

 
  <v-clicks>

  - Do ask questions!

  - Do answer questions!

  - Participation is a part of your discussion grade, and it also ensures we are all on the same page
    - This does NOT have to be a class where you learn math all by yourself
    - Asking and answering questions can help you and your peers
    - It'll also help me understand which concepts are straightforward vs. trickier!

  - Teaching is important to me, and I'd love to create an open, encouraging, and intellectual environment
    - Please feel free to provide feedback if you think anything can be improved

# From Lecture 1... Course Materials

:: left ::
## **There is *NO TEXTBOOK* for this course**

That means it's very important that you come to class, because we will go over all the material you need to know for the exams and assignments.


:: right ::

==However, we will use ...==

<p v-click>

## R and R Studio
We will use R and R studio for statistical analyses. Both are free and open-source software, which means you can download and use them without paying anything. 

This is **not** a coding class. We do not expect students to have prior programming experience, and we will walk you through everything you need to know. Do not panic!

# R vs. RStudio

:: left ::
<v-clicks>

- **R**
  - The programming language  
  - Where all the *functions* & calculations happen  

- **RStudio**
  - An *IDE* (Integrated Development Environment)  
  - Makes R easier to use with menus, tabs, and projects  
</v-clicks>

:: right ::
<v-clicks>

- Think of **R** as the *engine*  
- **RStudio** is the *car dashboard*  
- Weâ€™ll write code in RStudio â†’ it sends commands to R â†’ results appear in the console

# RStudio Interface: 4 Main Panes

<v-clicks>

- **Source**: Write & save scripts (.R or .Rmd files) that you can run later
- **Console**: Run commands immediately -- not part of a script!
- **Environment**: See output variables, datasets, loaded packages from your code
- **Plots/Files/Help**: Plots, file browser, documentation

# R Markdown Basics

:: left ::

<v-clicks>

- **Problem:**  Reading, writing, and grading raw R code can get messy  

- **Solution:**  R Markdown combines your **code**, **results**, and **write-ups** in one clean document  

- **Text cells:**  For explanations and notes â†’ uses simple Markdown syntax  

- **Code chunks:**  Place your R code here! Start with three backticks 
  
- **Knit button:** Runs code â†’ outputs a nicely formatted HTML/PDF/Word file

# Functions & Packages

:: content ::
<v-clicks>

- R comes with many built-in functions so that you don't have to do calculations by hand
  - **Functions**: Reusable commands â†’ `function_name(input)`  
  - e.g., `mean(c(1, 2, 3))` â†’ calculates average  

- However, there are some very useful functions (like plotting data) that can be installed from...
  - **Packages**: Add-on toolkits with extra functions  
  - Install once: `install.packages("ggplot2")`  
  - Load each session: `library(ggplot2)`  
  - These functions are written by different authors to make everyone's lives easier!

# Setting Up Your Project

:: content ::
<v-clicks>

- Create a folder named **PS_211** on Desktop (Mac or PC)  
- Open RStudio â†’ *File* â†’ *New Project* â†’ *Existing Directory* â†’ select **PS_211**  
- Save scripts/files inside this folder so everything stays organized  
- Pro tip: Use short file paths **without any spaces** â†’ easier to work with in R 
  - Good: PS_211 âœ“
  - Not so good: PS 211 âœ—
