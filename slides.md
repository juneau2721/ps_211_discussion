# Lecture 4: Central Tendency

:: content ::
- Central tendency = “center” of dataset
- **Mean**: arithmetic average; sensitive to outliers
- **Median**: middle score; 50th percentile; robust to outliers
- **Mode**: most common score; can be unimodal, bimodal, multimodal
- In normal distribution → mean = median = mode
- In skewed distributions → mean, median, mode differ
- Outliers distort mean; median less affected

# Lecture 4: Variability

:: content ::
- Variability = spread of scores
- **Range**: highest – lowest
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Q3 – Q1, middle 50%
- **Variance**: average squared deviation from mean
- **Standard deviation (SD)**: square root of variance
- Boxplots: show median, quartiles, IQR, outliers

# Lecture 5: Sampling

:: content ::
- Populations: entire group of interest
- Samples: subset used to estimate population
- **Random sample**: equal chance of selection; representative but hard
- **Convenience sample**: easier, common in psychology; less representative
- **Random assignment**: within experiments, ensures comparability of groups

# Lecture 5: Probability

:: content ::
- Probability = likelihood of outcome (0 to 1)
- Trial = repetition (e.g., dice roll); outcome = result; success = outcome of interest
- Independent trials: outcomes don’t affect each other (coin flips)
- Experimental probability: based on repeated trials
- Theoretical probability: based on known outcomes
- Common errors: gambler’s fallacy, overestimating rare events, confirmation bias

# Lecture 5: Hypothesis Testing

:: content ::
- Descriptive stats: summarize samples
- Inferential stats: generalize to populations
- Hypothesis testing uses probability to judge if sample result is likely under null hypothesis

# Worksheet for Today

:: content ::

1. Central Tendency: Your group has these exam scores — 70, 80, 90, 100.  
   a. What is the **mean**?  
   b. What is the **median**?  
   c. If we add an outlier score of 0, which measure changes the most?  

2. Variability: Imagine two classes both have a mean exam score of 80.  
- Class A: scores are 79, 80, 81  
- Class B: scores are 60, 80, 100  
   a. Which class has higher **variance/SD**?  
   b. Which class’s scores are more consistent?  

3. Sampling: A researcher wants to study BU students’ sleep habits.  
   a. Is recruiting volunteers from Psych 101 a **random** or **convenience** sample?  
   b. What is one advantage and one disadvantage of that choice?  

4. Random Assignment: Suppose you flip a coin to decide which students complete a math puzzle or a word puzzle.  
   a. What does random assignment accomplish in this experiment?  
   b. How is this different from random sampling?  

5. Probability: You flip a fair coin three times.  
   a. What is the probability of getting exactly 2 heads?  
   b. What is the probability of getting at least 1 tail?  

6. Wrap-up: Which concept from today’s lectures do you think will be **most important** for the upcoming exam?

# How to Brainstorm Research Ideas

:: content ::

- Start with **broad psych topics** that interest you (e.g., sleep, stress, social media, learning).  
- Ask: *What variables could we measure or manipulate?*  
  - IV = what we change (e.g., study environment, type of task)  
  - DV = what we measure (e.g., accuracy, reaction time, mood)  
- Look for **connections to everyday life** or current issues.  
- Keep it **simple and testable** within the scope of this class.
  - Although we will not be conducting experiments ourselves, our hypothetical study should still be attainable, understandable, and clearly tied to measurable variables.
- Be creative — but ground your ideas in **experimental design concepts** we’ve learned so far, so you can connect them directly to your poster.

# Discussion poster project

:: content ::

- In small groups, you will come up with a research hypothesis, conduct a literature review, and write hypothetical methods, results, and discussion sections to be presented on a poster at the end of the semester.
- **This week**, we will form groups of 3-4 and brainstorm research ideas
- Attend discussion! --> much easier to coordinate
  - Goal is no work outside of discussion section
