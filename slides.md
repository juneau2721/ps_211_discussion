# Exam bubble sheet instructions

:: content ::
- Bring a blue/black pen or pencil
- **Name in all caps**
- Must fill out **BU ID #** and **Exam Version**
- If you miss any of these things, then grading will be delayed for the entire class

# Poster Project: broad topics → testable hypotheses

:: content ::
<div style="line-height:.8; font-size:0.9em">

- Hypothesis = specific, directional prediction that connects your IV & DV  
- Must be **measurable**, **clear**, and **feasible**  
- Stuck? Think of hypotheses as "If..., then..." statements. *If (change in IV), then (change in DV)*
- Always specify the IV levels you’re comparing  
  - For >2 levels, describe the expected pattern (e.g., “Performance decreases as noise increases”) 
- E.g., “If students drink coffee before class, then their reaction times will be faster on a simple task compared to students who don’t.”
- E.g., “If people listen to upbeat music, then they will complete puzzles more quickly than when listening to calm music.”    
- E.g., “Students who study in quiet settings will recall more words than those who study with music.”
- During class, check in with me so we can workshop your group's hypothesis

# How to Brainstorm Research Ideas

:: content ::

- Start with **broad psych topics** that interest you (e.g., sleep, stress, social media, learning).  
- Ask: *What variables could we measure or manipulate?*  
  - IV = what we change (e.g., study environment, type of task)  
  - DV = what we measure (e.g., accuracy, reaction time, mood)  
- Look for **connections to everyday life** or current issues.  
- Keep it **simple and testable** within the scope of this class.
  - Although we will not be conducting experiments ourselves, our hypothetical study should still be attainable, understandable, and clearly tied to measurable variables.
- Be creative — but ground your ideas in **experimental design concepts** we’ve learned so far, so you can connect them directly to your poster.
