# Lecture 6: The Normal Curve & Z Scores

:: content ::
- Normal distributions: bell-shaped, symmetric, unimodal  
- Outliers/deviations from normal → can flag anomalies (e.g., fraud detection)  
- Standardization: convert raw scores → **z scores** (SDs from mean)  
- Z distribution: mean = 0, SD = 1  
- Compare across scales: z tells us relative standing  
- Percentiles: proportion of scores below a given z

# Lecture 7: Central Limit Theorem & Standard Error

:: content ::
- **Central Limit Theorem (CLT):** distribution of sample means ≈ normal if n is large  
- Even if raw scores aren’t normal, sample means will be  
- Distribution of means = less variable than raw scores  
- **Standard Error (SE):** SD of sample means  
  - Formula: SE = s / √n  
  - Larger samples → smaller SE → more precise estimates

# Worksheet for Today

:: left ::
1. Z Scores: A test has M = 70, SD = 10. You got an 85. 
  - What is the z score?  
  - Is it above/below average?  

2. CLT & SE: We have two samples from same population: n = 9 vs. n = 100.  
- Which has smaller SE? Why?  

3. Normal Curve  
- If z = 1, what % of scores are below it?  
- If z = −1, what % are above it?  

:: right ::
4. Hypothesis Testing  
- Suppose μ = 50, σ = 8.  
- Sample (n = 16): M = 46.  
  - Compute SE.  
  - Compute z.

5. Wrap-up  
- Share one real-life case where you’d want to compare two groups (IV levels). 
- How could you phrase it as H₀ vs. H₁?

# Last week: broad topics -> testable hypotheses

:: content ::
<div style="line-height:.8; font-size:0.9em">

- Hypothesis = specific, directional prediction that connects your IV & DV  
- Must be **measurable**, **clear**, and **feasible**  
- Stuck? Think of hypotheses as "If..., then..." statements. *If (change in IV), then (change in DV)*
- Always specify the IV levels you’re comparing  
  - For >2 levels, describe the expected pattern (e.g., “Performance decreases as noise increases”) 
- E.g., “If students drink coffee before class, then their reaction times will be faster on a simple task compared to students who don’t.”
- E.g., “If people listen to upbeat music, then they will complete puzzles more quickly than when listening to calm music.”    
- E.g., “Students who study in quiet settings will recall more words than those who study with music.”
- During class, check in with me so we can workshop your group's hypothesis

# This week: Refine topic and compile references

:: content ::
- Use Google Scholar or BU Library databases to search your topic  
- Start with **review articles** → they summarize many studies at once  
- Look for peer-reviewed journal articles, not blogs or random websites  
- Skim the abstract & conclusion first: does it clearly connect to your hypothesis?  
- Collect at least **3–5 solid references** this week to support your poster  
- Keep track of them in a shared doc (include citation info!) and show me
    - You may use any citation style as long as it is consistent
    - That said, I am most familiar with APA
- Tip: “cited by” on Google Scholar helps you find more recent follow-ups

# How to Brainstorm Research Ideas

:: content ::

- Start with **broad psych topics** that interest you (e.g., sleep, stress, social media, learning).  
- Ask: *What variables could we measure or manipulate?*  
  - IV = what we change (e.g., study environment, type of task)  
  - DV = what we measure (e.g., accuracy, reaction time, mood)  
- Look for **connections to everyday life** or current issues.  
- Keep it **simple and testable** within the scope of this class.
  - Although we will not be conducting experiments ourselves, our hypothetical study should still be attainable, understandable, and clearly tied to measurable variables.
- Be creative — but ground your ideas in **experimental design concepts** we’ve learned so far, so you can connect them directly to your poster.
