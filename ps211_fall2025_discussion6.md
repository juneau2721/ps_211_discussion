# Lecture 8: Z Tests & Confidence Intervals

:: content ::
<div style="line-height:.8; font-size:0.9em">

- **Z tests** compare a *sample mean* (**M**) to a *population mean* (**μ**, “mu”)  
  - Population standard deviation (**σ**, “sigma”) must be known  
- **Six steps of hypothesis testing**  
  1. Define the population your sample represents and what it’s compared to, and confirm your test is appropriate.
    - Check these assumptions: data approx. normal, scores independent, population standard deviation (sigma) is known
  2. State **H₀** (null: no effect) and **H₁** (research: expected effect)   
  3. Determine comparison distribution (find μ, σ, SE)
    - Establish the “reference” distribution if H₀ were true  
    - Find its **mean (μ)**, **standard deviation (σ)**, and **standard error (SE = σ / √n)**  
    - This lets us see how far M is from μ in standardized units (z)

# Lecture 8: Z Tests & Confidence Intervals

:: content ::
  4. Choose **α (alpha)**, the cutoff for significance — usually **.05** (5%)  
  5. Compute the **z statistic**  
  6. Decide: *reject* or *fail to reject* H₀  
- **p-value**: probability of your data (or more extreme) if H₀ is true  
  - p < α → statistically significant result  
- **Confidence Intervals (CIs):**  
  - Range of values that likely include the true μ  
  - 95% CI = M ± (1.96 × SE)  
  - Larger **n** or smaller **σ** → **smaller SE**, so CI becomes *tighter around the mean*, meaning a *more precise* estimate of μ

# Lecture 9: Effect Size, Power, and t Tests

:: content ::
<div style="line-height:.8; font-size:0.9em">

- **Effect size (Cohen’s d):** Formula: d = (M₁ − M₂) / SD  
  - M₁ and M₂ are group means (e.g., control vs. experimental)  
  - Describes the *magnitude* of a difference, regardless of sample size  
  - Small ≈ 0.2 · Medium ≈ 0.5 · Large ≈ 0.8  
- **Power:** probability of correctly rejecting H₀ *when it’s actually false*  
  - Greater power means the study is *more likely to detect a real effect*  
  - Power increases when:  
    - **Sample size (n)** is larger  
    - **Effect size (d)** is larger  
    - **Population variability (σ)** is smaller  
    - **One-tailed tests** are used instead of two-tailed

# Lecture 9: Effect Size, Power, and t Tests

:: content ::
- **t tests:** used when **σ** (population SD) is *unknown*  
  - Estimate variability using *sample SD (s)*  
  - Uses **t distribution** (wider tails, especially for small n)  
  - **Degrees of freedom (df)** = number of values that can vary = n − 1  
    - As df increases, t distribution approaches normal  
  - Used for:  
    - Single-sample t (sample vs. known μ)  
    - Paired-samples t (before vs. after)  
    - Independent-samples t (two separate groups)

# Worksheet for Today

:: left ::

<div style="line-height:.8; font-size:0.75em">

1. A researcher wants to compare BU students’ average sleep (M = 7 hours) to the national mean (μ = 8).  
   - When would a **z test** be appropriate?  
   - When would a **t test** be more realistic?  

2. A sample of 25 students has M = 70 and SD = 10.  
   - Estimate SE = SD / √n 
   - Estimate the 95% CI ≈ M ± (1.96 × SE) = [?, ?]. What does this interval tell us about μ?  

3. **Effect Size:** Two different studies both found a mean difference of 8 points between two groups (M1 - M2 = 8). However, the two studies have different SDs: Study A SD = 4, Study B SD = 12.  
   - Which study shows the larger effect size (Cohen's d)?  
   - Why would that same 8-point difference appear more distinct in one study than the other?
   
</div>

:: right ::

<div style="line-height:.8; font-size:0.75em">

4. **Power & Design:** Study A has 10 students per condition; Study B has 40 per condition.  
   - Which study has **greater statistical power**?  
   - If the variability (σ) increases, how would that affect power? Why?  

5. **Degrees of Freedom (df):** You have 5 scores and a fixed mean.  
   - If the mean is fixed, how many of the 5 scores can vary freely before the last one is determined?  
   - What does this number represent in a **t test**?

6. **Wrap-up Discussion:**  
   - Why is it better to report both **significance (p)** and **effect size (d)** on a poster? 
   - How do these two values tell *different stories* about your results?

# Poster Project: Writing Your Introduction (Part 1)

:: left ::
<div style="line-height:.8; font-size:0.9em">

- Your **Introduction** should now connect your **topic, prior research, and hypothesis**
- Write using **concise bullets**, not paragraphs  
- Focus on *logical flow*: each point should set up the next  
- Start big and then end specific to your experiment

#### Recommended structure:

Introduction:
1. **Topic importance** – why this question matters  
2. **Key findings from past studies** with citations
3. **Gap or motivation** – what is still unclear? 

</div>

:: right ::
<div style="line-height:.8; font-size:0.9em">

Hypothesis: 

4. **Your research question & hypothesis**  
   - “If (change in IV), then (change in DV)”  
    - Make sure to include all hypotheses, IV levels, and the specific, directional predicted pattern
   - e.g., Group A > Group B in accuracy  
   - or Performance decreases as noise increases  

**Goal for today:**

✅ Draft your bullet-style **Introduction**  
✅ Confirm that your **3–5 references** are credible (peer-reviewed or review articles)  
✅ During downtime, begin planning your **poster layout and design**

# Get ahead on your poster design!

:: left ::
<div style="line-height:.8; font-size:0.9em">

- Workshopping your **Introduction** will take a while — use any extra time to think about your **poster layout and design**  
- Decide as a **group** what tool and workflow will work best for collaboration  
- Look at **real poster examples** online for structure and inspiration  

#### Programs you could use for your poster
- **Google Slides**: easy group editing, PDF export
- Are students familiar with **Canva** or **Figma**? I'm not, but I heard you can use those to collaborate

</div>

:: right ::
<div style="line-height:.8; font-size:0.9em">

#### Design tips
- Use **large, readable fonts**
- **Limit text density** – 1 idea per line  
- Use **color sparingly** to highlight structure, not decorate  
- Align elements for a clean grid  
- Flow should feel natural: Intro → Methods → Results → Conclusion

# Broad topics -> testable hypotheses

:: content ::
<div style="line-height:.8; font-size:0.9em">

- Hypothesis = specific, directional prediction that connects your IV & DV  
- Must be **measurable**, **clear**, and **feasible**  
- Stuck? Think of hypotheses as "If..., then..." statements. *If (change in IV), then (change in DV)*
- Always specify the IV levels you’re comparing  
  - For >2 levels, describe the expected pattern (e.g., “Performance decreases as noise increases”) 
- E.g., “If students drink coffee before class, then their reaction times will be faster on a simple task compared to students who don’t.”
- E.g., “If people listen to upbeat music, then they will complete puzzles more quickly than when listening to calm music.”    
- E.g., “Students who study in quiet settings will recall more words than those who study with music.”
- During class, check in with me so we can workshop your group's hypothesis

# Refine topic and compile references

:: content ::
- Use Google Scholar or BU Library databases to search your topic  
- Start with **review articles** → they summarize many studies at once  
- Look for peer-reviewed journal articles, not blogs or random websites  
- Skim the abstract & conclusion first: does it clearly connect to your hypothesis?  
- Collect at least **3–5 solid references** this week to support your poster  
- Keep track of them in a shared doc (include citation info!) and show me
    - You may use any citation style as long as it is consistent
    - That said, I am most familiar with APA
- Tip: “cited by” on Google Scholar helps you find more recent follow-ups

# How to Brainstorm Research Ideas

:: content ::

- Start with **broad psych topics** that interest you (e.g., sleep, stress, social media, learning).  
- Ask: *What variables could we measure or manipulate?*  
  - IV = what we change (e.g., study environment, type of task)  
  - DV = what we measure (e.g., accuracy, reaction time, mood)  
- Look for **connections to everyday life** or current issues.  
- Keep it **simple and testable** within the scope of this class.
  - Although we will not be conducting experiments ourselves, our hypothetical study should still be attainable, understandable, and clearly tied to measurable variables.
- Be creative — but ground your ideas in **experimental design concepts** we’ve learned so far, so you can connect them directly to your poster.
