# Central Tendency

:: content ::
- Central tendency describes the “center” of a dataset.  
- It identifies the value that scores cluster around.  
- The three common measures of central tendency are mean, median, and mode.

# The Mean

:: content ::
- The mean is the arithmetic average of a dataset.  
- It is calculated by adding all scores together and dividing by the number of scores.  
- The mean balances the distribution, like a fulcrum.

# The Median

:: content ::
- The median is the middle score when all scores are ordered from lowest to highest.  
- If there is an even number of scores, the median is the average of the two middle scores.  
- The median represents the 50th percentile of the data.

# The Mode

:: content ::
- The mode is the most common score in the dataset.  
- A distribution may be unimodal (one mode), bimodal (two modes), or multimodal (many modes).  
- The mode is not always useful if many values occur with the same frequency.

# Comparing Mean, Median, and Mode

:: content ::
- In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are equal.  
- In a negatively skewed distribution, the mean is less than the median, which is less than the mode.  
- In a positively skewed distribution, the mode is less than the median, which is less than the mean.

# Outliers

:: content ::
- Outliers are extreme values that differ greatly from the rest of the data.  
- Outliers can distort the mean, making it less representative of the dataset.  
- The median is less affected by outliers and can be a better measure of central tendency in skewed data.

# Parametric vs. Non-Parametric Statistics

:: content ::
- Parametric tests are powerful but assume normality, equal variance, independence, and no extreme outliers.  
- Non-parametric tests do not require these assumptions and are often used with ordinal data.  
- Non-parametric tests are less powerful but still useful when assumptions are not met.

### Lecture 4: Variability

# Variability

:: content ::
- Variability describes how spread out the scores in a distribution are.  
- The three common measures are range, variance, and standard deviation.  
- Distributions with higher variability show greater spread between scores.

# Range

:: content ::
- The range is the difference between the highest and lowest score.  
- For example, if the highest quiz score is 90 and the lowest is 70, the range is 20.  
- The range is simple to compute, but it only depends on two scores and can be distorted by outliers.

# Interquartile Range

:: content ::
- The interquartile range (IQR) measures the distance between the 25th percentile (Q1) and 75th percentile (Q3).  
- The IQR represents the middle 50% of the data.  
- Because it is less influenced by outliers, the IQR is often a more robust measure of variability.

# Variance

:: content ::
- Variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean.  
- Squaring the deviations prevents them from canceling out.  
- A larger variance means scores are more spread out.  
- Variance is expressed in squared units, which can be harder to interpret directly.

:: title ::
# Standard Deviation

:: content ::
- The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.  
- It represents the typical amount that each score deviates from the mean.  
- Larger standard deviations indicate greater spread, while smaller ones indicate that scores cluster more closely around the mean.

# Variability in SPSS

:: content ::
- In SPSS, descriptive statistics can be used to compute range, variance, and standard deviation.  
- These values appear in the output window and provide a quick summary of variability in your dataset.
