# Outline for Today
:: content ::
- **Attendance:** please sign your name at the front within the first 2 minutes.
- **Lecture 10 Review:** paired-samples *t*-tests and the logic of mean differences  
    - Clarify what a *mean difference* really represents.   
- **Submit your Introduction** within the first 30 minutes  
    - You’ve had two weeks to work on this, so it should be complete or nearly complete.  
    - Post a Google Doc link with your introduction and references in **Slack** so I can review it.  
    - Use the past discussion slides as a checklist to make sure it’s polished.   
- **Worksheet Practice:** interpreting *t*-values and confidence intervals  
- **Poster Work:** begin drafting the *Methods* section of your project

# Recap – What’s a Mean Difference?
:: content ::
- Each participant has **two related scores** (e.g., before vs after).  
- Subtract one from the other → each person’s **difference score D**.  
- The **mean difference M_D** is the *average of all those D scores*.  
- If there’s truly no effect, we expect that average difference ≈ 0.  
- The t-test asks: *Is our observed M_D large enough that random noise alone probably wouldn’t create it?*

# The Standard Error (SE)
:: content ::
- SE tells us how much sample means (or mean differences) typically vary across random samples.  
- Formula for paired t: SE = s (sample standard deviation) / √n  
- s describes variability within one sample, while SE describes variability between possible samples
- Smaller SE → more precise estimate → larger t (if difference stays constant).  
- When SE is big, even a 1-point mean difference may be *statistically weak*; when SE is small, that same difference may be *statistically strong*.

# The Logic of the t Statistic
:: content ::
- t = (M_D - 0) / SE_D  
- Numerator = observed difference  
- Denominator = expected variation if H0 true  
- Big t → unlikely under H0 → reject H0  
- Small t → plausible under H0 → fail to reject  
- The sign (+ or –) only shows direction, not magnitude of evidence.

# Interpreting Confidence Intervals
:: content ::
- 95 % CI = M_D ± (t_crit × SE_D)  
- Shows plausible range for the *true* mean difference in the population.  
- If 0 is inside the interval → we can’t rule out no difference.  
- If 0 is outside the interval → difference is statistically significant.  
- CI width shrinks as sample size increases or variability decreases.

# Common Misunderstandings
:: content ::
- “Mean difference” ≠ “difference of means” – we only have one group’s change scores here.  
- A non-significant t doesn’t mean *no effect* – it means we lack enough evidence.  
- Larger n reduces SE but doesn’t change the raw difference itself.  
- Reporting both t and Cohen’s d helps show *strength* vs *certainty* of the effect.

# Quick Practice
:: content ::
**Scenario 1:**  
Five students report hours of sleep before and after midterms:  
6.0, 6.5, 5.5, 7.0, 6.0 → 7.0, 7.0, 6.0, 7.5, 6.5  

1. Compute each difference (after – before).  
2. Find the mean difference and estimate SE (s / √n).  
3. If t_crit = ±2.776 and your t = 1.8, do we reject H0?  
4. Interpret in plain English.

# Transition to Poster Methods Section
:: content ::
- The Methods section explains *how you would test* your hypothesis.  
- Include:  
  1. Participants – who and how many?  
  2. Design – within- or between-subjects? (you can now define this clearly!)  
  3. Procedure – what participants do, what you measure.  
  4. Dependent variable – how is it quantified and analyzed?  
  5. Independent variable - how will you manipulate this?
- Begin a short outline today and raise your hand when you're ready for feedback
