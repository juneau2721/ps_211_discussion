# Communication logistics

:: content ::

<p v-click>

- We will use **Slack** for class communication. Everyone should be added. Please reach out to Kate or Juneau if you are not yet on the Slack workspace.

</p>

<p v-click>

- Please check Slack regularly for important announcements. 

</p>

<p v-click>

- Please also use the Slack to ask questions about course material!

    - In general, our policy is that if you ask us a question about course material, we will publicly post it (anonymously, if you desire) and the answer on Slack, so that everyone can benefit from the learning opportunity.

</p>

<p v-click>

- That said, our hope is that you will take advantage of lecture, discussion, and office hours to ask questions **IN PERSON**. If you send us a content-based question via email or slack, we may ask you to come to office hours or ask during lecture/discussion instead.


<div class="mt-8 w-full flex justify-center">
  <div class="bg-yellow-100 border-2 border-yellow-300 rounded-lg shadow-md p-4 transform -rotate-1">
    Please come talk to us!

# Course Materials

:: left ::
## **There is *NO TEXTBOOK* for this course**

That means it's very important that you come to class, because we will go over all the material you need to know for the exams and assignments.


:: right ::

==However, we will use ...==

<p v-click>

## R and R Studio
We will use R and R studio for statistical analyses. Both are free and open-source software, which means you can download and use them without paying anything. 

This is **not** a coding class. We do not expect students to have prior programming experience, and we will walk you through everything you need to know. Do not panic!

# Class Policies: Ask for Help

:: content ::

If you’re struggling or perform poorly on an exam or assignment:  
- Come to office hours and talk to us!
- We will not be returning exams, but we can go over what you got wrong and how to improve.

<br> 

<p v-click>

Take advantage of campus resources, including the:

# Class Policies: Collaboration and Use of Artificial Intelligence

:: content ::

**Collaboration is a huge part of science. Learning how to collaborate effectively is an important skill.**
- As such, you are allowed to ask each other for help on homework assignments and data write-ups.
- However, you must each submit your own work. Copying someone else’s work is plagiarism. 

<p v-click>

<br> 

**You may also use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) to help you with your code.**
- However, use them cautiously. They can be wrong! 
- In addition, remember that you will need to understand the statistical concepts, as you will complete the exams on your own without any help.

</p>

<p v-click>

*There will be a place on the assignment to acknowledge your collaborators and any AI tools you used. You will not be penalized for collaboration or use of AI if you disclose it honestly.*

</p>

# Getting started with R and R Studio

:: content ::

## Why are we using R?

<p v-click>

- R is a free and powerful programming language for data analysis and visualization.
- R is widely used in academia and industry.

</p>

<p v-click>

- My goal in this course is to introduce you to R. You will be able to do well (and get a 100) in this class *without becoming fluent in R.* 
  - You are welcome to go above and beyond the course requirements and challenge yourself to learn more R on your own!
  - I use R in my own research and am always happy to talk to students who want to learn more.

</p>

<p v-click>
<div class="mt-8 w-full flex justify-center">
  <div class="bg-green-100 border-2 border-green-300 rounded-lg shadow-md p-4 transform">
    You may even find it fun!
