One aspect of my job is to teach this course, but the main part of my job is to run a research lab.

<img src="/public/images/lab_logo.png" alt="CoLD Lab" class="w-full rounded-lg border-2 border-indigo-200 shadow-lg" />

We investigate how learning, memory, and decision-making change across development.

We use statistics every day!

# Communication logistics

:: content ::

<p v-click>

- We will use **Slack** for class communication. Everyone should be added. Please reach out to Kate or Juneau if you are not yet on the Slack workspace.

</p>
<p v-click>

- Please check Slack regularly for important announcements. 

</p>

<p v-click>

- Please also use the Slack to ask questions about course material!

    - In general, our policy is that if you ask us a question about course material, we will publicly post it (anonymously, if you desire) and the answer on Slack, so that everyone can benefit from the learning opportunity.

</p>
<p v-click>

- That said, our hope is that you will take advantage of lecture, discussion, and office hours to ask questions **IN PERSON**. If you send us a content-based question via email or slack, we may ask you to come to office hours or ask during lecture/discussion instead.


<div class="mt-8 w-full text-center">
  <span class="bg-indigo-100 text-indigo-500 p-2 border-2 border-indigo-200 rounded-lg px-4">
    Please come talk to us!

# What is this class?

:: content ::
- Intro to the logic and processes of  descriptive & inferential statistics for psychology.  
- Not a math memorization class — you won’t be memorizing complex formulas.  
- You’ll  analyze data  with statistical software  (R and R Studio) to test hypotheses and interpret results.  


<p v-click>

We will cover: Statistical inference, significance, and tests such as t-tests, ANOVAs, correlation, and regression.

</p>

<p v-click>

The goal is for you to strengthen your critical thinking an quantative reasoning skills, and learn how to conduct statistical analyses and interpret their results ==*with as little pain as possible.*==

</p>

<p v-click>

This is my first time teaching this course! (or any course!) Please feel free to give us feedback throughout the semester. An anonymous feedback form will be posted on Slack.

# Course Materials

:: left ::
## **There is *NO TEXTBOOK* for this course**

That means it's very important that you come to class, because we will go over all the material you need to know for the exams and assignments.



:: right ::

==However, we will use ...==

<p v-click>

## R and R Studio
We will use R and R studio for statistical analyses. Both are free and open-source software, which means you can download and use them without paying anything. 

This is **not** a coding class. We do not expect students to have prior programming experience, and we will walk you through everything you need to know. Do not panic!

- Missing class limits learning & participation.
- Students who attend lectures (esp. later in semester) generally earn better grades.  
- In class we go over problems that prepare you for assessments.
- All lecture slides will be posted right before or after class, but they will be hard to understand without attending.

- **Attendance is highly encouraged but not required**
  <p v-click>There will be occasional pop quizzes administered in class (lecture and discussion). </p>
  <p v-click>These short multiple-choice quizzes will enable you to earn bonus points on the next exam. </p>

# Class Policies: Collaboration and Use of Artificial Intelligence

:: content ::
- Collaboration is a huge part of science. Learning how to collaborate effectively is an important skill.
- As such, you are allowed to ask each other for help on homework assignments and data write-ups.
- However, you must each submit your own work. Copying someone else’s work is plagiarism. 
- You may also use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) to help you with your code.
- However, use them cautiously. They can be wrong! 
- In addition, remember that you will need to understand the statistical concepts, as you will complete the exams on your own without any help.

<p v-click>If you work with others or use AI for your assignments, please note this. There will be a place on the assignment to acknowledge your collaborators and any AI tools you used. You will not be penalized for collaboration or use of AI if you disclose it honestly. </p>
