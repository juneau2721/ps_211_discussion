# Finalizing Your Introduction

:: content ::
<div style="line-height:.85; font-size:0.85em">

- If your draft is mostly complete, focus on **clarity, conciseness, and logical flow**  
- If still in progress, make sure you have:  
  1. A clear **topic statement** (what the study is about)  
  2. **3–5 credible references** that connect directly to your hypothesis  
  3. A **gap statement** — what question remains unanswered?  
  4. A **specific, directional hypothesis** (clear IVs, DVs, and predicted pattern)

#### Revision Checklist
- Does each bullet flow naturally from broad → specific?  
- Do your citations use a **consistent style** (APA preferred, but consistency matters more)?  
- Replace filler phrases (“Researchers have long been interested...”) with **specific findings**.
- Ensure your final sentence naturally transitions into your **Methods** section next week.

# Introduction Example

:: content ::
<div style="line-height:.85; font-size:0.9em">

Your introduction **does NOT** and **should NOT** copy this example. This is simply to show how to:   
- Include only **relevant background facts** and **remove extra information or unnecessary filler** words
- Maintain logical **flow**; move from **broad → specific**; and end with a **smooth transition** into your study

**Example: Group Study & Confidence**

- Many students study in groups to prepare for exams
- Collaboration can boost understanding but sometimes also leads to overconfidence (Lastname, 2008).
- Students often feel more certain when surrounded by peers (Lastname, 2015).  
- Few studies directly test whether group study actually improves confidence without improving accuracy.
- **Research question:** Does group study change confidence in one's answers?
- **Hypothesis:** Students who study in groups will rate their confidence higher, but show similar accuracy to those who study alone.

# Citation polish & credibility

:: left ::
- Use **Google Scholar** to double-check source details  
- Prefer **peer-reviewed journal articles** or review papers  
- Avoid blogs, AI summaries, and Wikipedia  
- Each **reference should support a clear point** — it’s a foundation, not filler.   
- Short parenthetical style is fine (e.g., *Smith et al., 2021*)  

:: right ::
#### Quick reference tips
- “Cited by” count helps identify influential papers  
- If you can’t access full text → try BU Library proxy or “All versions” on Scholar  
- Format example (APA 7):  
  > Smith, A. B., & Jones, C. D. (2020). Sleep and attention. *Journal of Cognition*, 45(2), 123–135.

# Poster Project: Introduction → Methods bridge

:: content ::
- Next week we’ll start your **Methods** section  
- Think ahead: what information will readers need?  
  - Who are your participants? How many?
  - What is your independent variable (IV)?  
  - What is your dependent variable (DV)?  
  - How would you measure or operationalize each variable?
    - If these are hard to define, cite studies that have successfully done so and model your approach after theirs. 
- Your Introduction should naturally **set up** these details  
  - e.g., “Methods: To test this, we will compare ____ and ____ on ____.”

# Goals for Today

:: content ::

- Finish your introduction and show me!
- Ensure all sources are cited and show me both draft and references. 
 - You can add more sources as needed, I just want to make sure your reference style looks good.
- Begin working on your **poster design** (see last week’s design tips).  
- Start thinking about your **Methods** section — how could you actually test these variables? 
  - Do your previous sources already operationalize them successfully?
