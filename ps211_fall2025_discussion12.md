# Quick Review: What is Correlation?
:: content ::


- Correlation = a **systematic association** between two **numeric** variables  
- Pearson’s *r* ranges from −1 to +1
  - Measures **direction** (positive/negative) and **strength** (small/medium/large)
  - r ≈ .10 (small), .30 (medium), .50 (large)
  - Outliers can dramatically change r
  - R² tells you the % variance that two variables share

# Quick Review: Important notes about correlation
:: content ::


- Correlation **does not equal causation**
  - We typically use correlations in **observational** (non-experimental) research 
  - We cannot assume causation because:
    - We did **not manipulate an IV** (no experiment)
    - Other variables (third variables) may explain the relationship
    - We do not know the **direction** of the effect (which variable influences which)
- r close to 0 does **not** always mean “not related” — relationship may be non-linear

# Poster checklist
:: content ::

- Title
- Group members' names
- Introduction -- broad to focused: background literature with citations, research question, hypothesis
- Methods -- participants, IVs, DVs, procedure, design (within/between)
- Analysis plan -- correct statistical test, calculate degrees of freedom, correct effect size, result statements
- Limitations -- 1-3 that cannot be resolved by your experiment
- References -- cited in APA or another style
- **Submitted to Blackboard by 20 min into class**
  - I will project your submission image or PDF for your presentation next week

# What’s Coming Next: last discussion!
:: content ::

- **Next Week (Discussion 13):**  
  - **Poster Presentations in class**  
  - Focus on clarity and reasoning
  - Each group member should contribute to the presentation
  - You will talk through your poster in ~3-5 minutes, at the front of the class
    - If you take longer than 6 min, I will stop you
    - That way we have enough time to do review questions in class

# Poster Presentation Final Rubric
:: content ::

<div style="line-height:0.6; font-size:0.75em">

- The poster presentation is a part of your discussion participation grade. I will grade based on:
  - **Poster Visual Organization**: Logical layout, readable text, appropriate level of detail
    - Clear separation between Introduction, Methods, Analysis Plan, Limitations
    - Everything on the checklist (previous slide) is included
  - **Verbal Clarity**: Explain your reasoning clearly (not too much detail, not too little)
    - Natural “broad → specific” flow when you talk through your poster
    - Your explanations match what is written on the poster
  - **Accuracy**: Hypothetical result statements match the design and hypotheses
    - Correct statistical test and correct degrees of freedom
    - Correct effect size choice (Cohen’s d or η²)
  - **Speaking & Group Participation**: Even division of speaking time
    - Smooth transitions between group members
    - Good pacing (~3-5 minutes, not over 6)

# Goals for Today

:: content ::
- Submit your **poster draft** (PDF or image) to Blackboard by 20 min into class
- Practice your **poster presentation** with your group
  - Explain your design in plain language  
  - Make sure every group member can explain the analysis plan  
  - Practice staying within the ~5-minute window  
- Ask questions so you feel confident presenting next week
  - During downtime, work through the **Correlation Worksheet** in your group

# During downtime: correlation worksheet

:: content ::

1. Interpreting scatterplots: draw a scatterplot (axes, scatterpoints, and trend line) that:

(a) Has a positive, strong relationship.
(b) Has a negative, strong relationship.
(c) Has a positive, weak relationship.
(d) Has an r = 0 but clearly has some other nonlinear relationship

2. Identifying outliers: look at scatterplot from (1a). If we place an outlier below the trendline, will the r value become more positive or more negative?

3. If the r value for (1a) is 0.50, what does that tell you about the variance in the data?

4. Correlation vs. causation: "A researcher found r = .55 between **daily screen time** and **anxiety symptoms**.
a. Give **two possible third variables** that might explain this correlation.  
b. Explain why we **cannot** conclude that screen time causes anxiety. Your answer must be a full sentence, clearly show understanding, and cannot just say "correlation does not imply causation."

5. Pick two variables from everyday life (e.g., sleep hours & mood; caffeine & alertness).
a. Predict whether the relationship is **positive**, **negative**, or **none**.  
b. Predict whether the correlation is **small**, **medium**, or **large**.  
c. Explain why.
