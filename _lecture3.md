# Visual Displays of Data Save Lives

:: content ::
- Florence Nightingale used graphs to communicate the causes of death of British soldiers in the mid-1800s.  
- Her famous coxcomb plot showed that poor hygiene killed more soldiers than battle wounds.  
- This demonstrates how visual displays can reveal critical information that might otherwise be overlooked.

# Misleading Graphs

:: content ::
- Visual displays can also confuse or mislead if designed poorly.  
- For example, a graph comparing Cornell’s tuition and ranking used mismatched axes and reversed meanings of up and down.  
- This made it appear that Cornell’s ranking declined when in fact it improved.

# How to Lie with Graphs

:: content ::
- Graphs can mislead with biased scales, such as star ratings where the lowest score is still “good.”  
- Biased samples, such as Amazon reviews written by a non-random group, can distort results.  
- Interpolation assumes a straight line between two points, which may not reflect reality.  
- Extrapolation assumes trends continue indefinitely, which is often not the case.  
- Inaccurate visuals can distort values, such as bar graphs that misrepresent scale.

# Common Types of Graphs

:: content ::
- Scatterplots show the relationship between two numerical variables.  
- Line graphs show relationships or changes over time.  
- Bar graphs compare groups when the independent variable is categorical.  
- Pictorial graphs use images but can mislead.  
- Pie charts show proportions but are rarely the best choice.

# Scatterplots

:: content ::
- A scatterplot displays the relationship between two numerical variables.  
- Each participant contributes one point, plotted by their scores on both variables.  
- Scatterplots can show no relation, a positive relation, a negative relation, or a nonlinear relation.

# Line Graphs

:: content ::
- Line graphs connect data points to illustrate trends.  
- A time series plot places time on the x-axis and a numerical variable on the y-axis.  
- These plots are especially useful for showing change over time.

# Bar Graphs and Pareto Charts

:: content ::
- A bar graph shows the average value of a dependent variable for each level of a categorical independent variable.  
- A Pareto chart orders categories from highest to lowest, making comparisons easier.  
- Bars should typically start at zero to avoid exaggerating differences.

# Choosing the Right Graph

:: content ::
- A histogram is best when showing frequencies of one numerical variable.  
- A scatterplot or line graph is best when showing the relationship between two numerical variables.  
- A bar graph is best when comparing groups based on a categorical independent variable.

# Best Practices

:: content ::
- Graphs should have clear titles and labeled axes.  
- Units of measurement should always be shown.  
- Colors should be chosen for clarity, not decoration.  
- Avoid “chartjunk” such as unnecessary patterns, distracting backgrounds, or excessive graphics.

# Entering Data in SPSS

:: content ::
- In SPSS, the Variable View defines each variable’s name, label, and measurement type.  
- The Data View allows you to enter participant data into rows and columns.  
- Once data are entered, you can generate frequency distributions and graphs such as histograms.
