# Review: Subcategories of Variables

:: content ::
- **Continuous variables**: Infinite values; fractions possible  
- **Discrete variables**: Only specific values; no fractions (e.g., number of pets)

# Review: Discrete Variables

:: left ::
- **Nominal**: categories with names (e.g., Democrat = 1, Republican = 0; numbers meaningless)  
- **Ordinal**: rankings with order, but no fractions (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd place)

# Review: Continuous Variables

:: left ::
- **Interval**: equal intervals, no true zero (e.g., temperature °C)  
- **Ratio**: equal intervals, true zero (e.g., lever presses = 0)

# Many Questions in Psychology = Many Research Methods

:: content ::
- **Non-Experimental**  
  - Naturalistic/Observational  
  - Case Studies  
  - Surveys & Questionnaires  
  - Correlations  

- **Experimental**  
  - Manipulate independent variables to observe effect on dependent variables

# Defining Experimental Variables

:: content ::
- **Independent Variable (IV)**: manipulated, has 2+ levels  
- **Dependent Variable (DV)**: outcome, hypothesized to depend on IV

# Practice: Identifying Variables

:: content ::
**Study 1**:  
Half of students attend lecture but don’t read textbook; half read textbook but don’t attend lecture. Both tested.  

- IV: Lecture vs. Textbook  
- DV: Test scores

# Practice: Identifying Variables

:: content ::
**Study 2**:  
Half of fraternity watched *Inconvenient Truth*; half watched *Barbie*. Then rated climate change attitudes.  

- IV: Movie watched  
- DV: Attitudes towards climate change

# Reliability and Validity

:: content ::
- **Reliability**: consistency across repeated measures  
- **Validity**: measuring what it’s supposed to measure  

Examples:  
- A scale shows same weight today & tomorrow → reliable  
- SATs measure college success? → validity question

:: title ::
# Can a measure be...

:: content ::
- Reliable but not valid? → **YES** (e.g., Sorting Hat always → Hufflepuff, but not true personality)  
- Valid but not reliable? → **NO** (must be consistent to be accurate)

# Reliability & Validity Example: Wine Ratings

:: content ::
- Corsi & Ashenfelter (2001): studied consistency of wine experts’ ratings  
- IVs: Temperature & rainfall (continuous)  
- DV: Wine ratings (discrete)  
- Findings: Experts consistent (reliable), Parker’s ratings aligned with drinkers (valid)

# The Problem of Confounds

:: content ::
- **Confounding Variable**: varies with IV → hard to know cause of DV  
- Example: Ice cream sales track with shark attacks → confound = **temperature**  
- Example: Hurricane Irma → wind vs. water damage confounded

# Variables on Graphs

:: content ::
- **X-axis** = Independent Variable  
- **Y-axis** = Dependent Variable

:: title ::
# Experimental Example: Stroop Task

:: content ::
- Measure reaction time  
- **Congruent condition**: word & color match  
- **Incongruent condition**: word & color mismatch → slower RTs  
- IV: Condition (congruent vs. incongruent)  
- DV: Reaction time

# Hypothesis Testing & Operational Definitions

:: content ::
- **Hypothesis**: testable prediction about variables  
- **Operational definition**: how variable is measured (e.g., anxiety via questionnaire, HR, sweating)

# Correlation vs. Experiment

:: content ::
- **Correlation**: variables observed as-is → relationship, not causality  
- **Experiment**: random assignment, manipulates IV → causal inference

:: title ::
# Between vs. Within Subjects

:: left ::
- **Between-groups**: each participant in one IV level only  
- **Within-groups**: each participant in all IV levels  

:: right ::
<div class="bg-green-100 border-2 border-green-300 rounded-lg shadow-md p-4">
  Can you think of advantages and disadvantages of each?

# Data Ethics

:: content ::
- Ethics in **design, collection, analysis, interpretation, reporting**  
- Examples:  
  - Uber hack (2016) → failure of data protection  
  - Marc Hauser case (2012) → falsifying data

# The Reproducibility Crisis

:: content ::
- 51–89% of published findings can’t be replicated  
- $28B wasted annually in U.S. on irreproducible results  
- Contributing factors:  
  - Publication bias against negative results  
  - HARKing (hypothesizing after results known)  
  - Weak statistical methods  

---
layout: top-title

:: title ::
# Open Science

:: content ::
- **Pre-registration**: state hypotheses, design, and analysis before study  
- Encourages replication, transparency, accountability  
- Helps prevent questionable practices (e.g., HARKing)
